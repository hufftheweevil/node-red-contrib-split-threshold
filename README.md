# Split Threshold for Node-RED

A node that runs a timer if a value goes beyond a threshold, and stops the timer on a different threshold. A message is sent when the timer ends. It can configured to run multiple timers at once, by handling messages based on a property. The timers are persistant through re-deployment of flows.
